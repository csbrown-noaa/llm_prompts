_run_analysis.R:

`here` library did not have appropriate markers for project root.  This is not really GEMINI's fault, and would have worked in a normal project, but I did have to add a `.here` file in the root directory.

paths to generated csv files were incorrect.  Had to rename both the directories and the paths.
