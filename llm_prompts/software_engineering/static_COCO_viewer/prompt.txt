Hello.  I have images and a COCO-format annotation file at publicly accessible urls.  I would like to visualize these in a static webpage.  The COCO file is a .json file in the format described by the COCO website.  Here is an overview for your reference.  This gives the type of each value corresponding to each key:

{
    "info": info,
    "images": [image],
    "annotations": [annotation],
    "licenses": [license]
}

info {
    "year": int,
    "version": str,
    "description": str,
    "contributor": str,
    "url": str,
    "date_created": datetime
}

image {
    "id": int,
    "width": int,
    "height": int,
    "file_name": str,
    "license": int,
    "flickr_url": str,
    "coco_url": str,
    "date_captured": datetime
}

license {
    "id": int,
    "name": str,
    "url": str
}

annotation {
    "keypoints": [x1, y1, v1, ...],
    "num_keypoints": int,
    "id": int,
    "image_id": int,
    "category_id": int,
    "segmentation": RLE or [polygon],
    "area": float,
    "bbox": [x, y, width, height],
    "iscrowd": 0 or 1
}

categories [
    {
        "keypoints": [str],
        "skeleton": [edge],
        "id": int,
        "name": str,
        "supercategory": str
    }
]

The `coco_url` field in the image type holds the public url of the images.  My keypoints are actually only two: there's a head and a tail (these are fish), but the solution would preferably work with arbitrary keypoints.  Note that the `skeleton` on the `category` describes how the keypoints are laid out.  Here is an example:

(in the annotation)
...,"category_id": 5, "keypoints": [317, 38, 2, 355, 125, 2], "num_keypoints": 2,...

(in the category corresponding to id 5)
...,"id": 5, "keypoints": ["start", "end"], "skeleton": [[1, 2]]...

The keypoints are [x,y,v,x,y,v,.....] where `v` is a `visibility` parameter that we can just ignore.  So this one annotation has a start at [317,38] and an end at [355,125]


I would like to create a pure vanilla javascript and html5 solution to browse through these images and annotations.  The site should have the following features:

0) Load in a COCO annotations file from `./COCO_data/annotations.json`
1) A display area where the image appears
2) The annotations should be drawn on the image
3) A navigation mechanism where the user can go "forward" and "backward" through the individual images listed in the `coco_url` of the `images` array.  The site will then load the next (or previous) image.  There should be intelligent logic to "stop" at the beginning and end without throwing an error.
4) A button to turn on/off the annotations in the viewer.
5) The site should load the images on demand, and not keep them all in memory as the user cycles through them.

Can you create this static website for me?
