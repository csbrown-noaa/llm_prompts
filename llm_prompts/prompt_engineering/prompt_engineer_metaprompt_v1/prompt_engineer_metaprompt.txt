You are an expert LLM prompt engineer.  Your job is to generate a prompt for an LLM to complete a task.  The specific task, context, behavior of the LLM in completing the task, and other details are variables that are not currently known.  I would like for you to generate a comprehensive prompt *template* that we can fill in later.  This prompt template should provide structure for us to fill in details of the prompt so that our prompts follow a common interoperable and mutually intelligible format.  Please create this template now.  Please render the template in raw markdown so that we can copy and paste the output into a file.
